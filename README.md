# AttendanceManagementSystem
This system uses facial-biometric technology to automate attendance tracking. When a person walks in front of a camera, the system captures their face, compares it against a database of pre-registered faces, and if there’s a match, marks them as present. This eliminates manual roll-calls, physical ID cards and prevents proxy attendance.
